# 30DayCodingChallenge
This Challenge will Last from 1st to 30th October 2020, I'll be updating the ReadMe and Code daily for this period.
## Day 2
Today I worked with Data types, Static and Initializer block, Variables and Type Casting.
Bascially Static and Initializer blocks allow you execute code and declare variables before the main method runs, code blocks in static or intializer blocks are executed from the class complialtion by the JVM, this way the program starts execution from their results before heading to the main method.

For Variables, they are named memory spaces allocated for holding values in a program. 
>Every variable has a data type, and data types are divided into two namely;
Primitive and  Non Primitive types.

- Primitive types: Values may change in the program but the Data Type is constant. Includes; Integer, Char, Boolean, Long e.t.c
- Non Primitive types: They are aso refered to as Reference types, They are used to refer to an object and the data type remains constant. Example String.

Each variable has a name which is refered to as an identifier, i.e int number1; (In this case `int` is the data type while `number1` is the identifier for the variable. 
A Static variable is one whose value cannot be changed after initialisation and cannot be defined within a method i.e as a local variable.

**See code for more details, unto the next day in 20hrs.**

## Day 1
Today I read up on the history of Java, how it all started in 1995 and it took 18 months to create the language used worldwide today. The concept of Object Oriented Programming entails:
- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

Well then I wrote my First Java program for the challenge.
Code is available in the repository, download the classLearning.java file, run cmd in the directory of the file and do the following commands::

1. javac ClassLearning.java (If code compiles correctly CMD will bring up a new line)
2. java LearningJava (I used a different class name from the name of the file, this is a wrong move for programming as a whole and should not be practiced, file names should be the same as class names.).

**Thanks for joining in, see you tomorow.**
