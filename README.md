# 30DayCodingChallenge
This Challenge will Last from 1st to 30th October 2020, I'll be updating the ReadMe and Code daily for this period.

## Day 1
Today I read up on the history of Java, how it all started in 1995 and it took 18 months to create the language used worldwide today. The concept of Object Oriented Programming entails:
- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

Well then I wrote my First Java program for the challenge.
Code is available in the repository, download the classLearning.java file, run cmd in the directory of the file and do the following commands::

1. javac ClassLearning.java (If code compiles correctly CMD will bring up a new line)
2. java LearningJava (I used a different class name from the name of the file, this is a wrong move for programming as a whole and should not be practiced, file names should be the same as class names.).

**Thanks for joining in, see you tomorow.**
